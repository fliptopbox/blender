Last year we did a brand over haul, which also meant we had a massive website update after that was launched we had the tedious task of cleaning up our design dept.

(old logo -> new logo)

For the most part it was a matter of uploading a new logo to replace the old one on the various platforms, like Github, NPM, Glassdoor, however when it comes to video assets its not that easy.

But it did give me the opportunity to re-think our video channel and the workflow for creating consistently branded thumbnails and predictable into and outro animations.

TLDR;

- Make a Figma template of the YouTube channel assets: poster, background, thumbnail.
- Create the intro and outro animations comparing:
  - Blender with geometry nodes
  - Blackmagic Resolve with Fusion
  - FFmpeg
- Create bash scripts that uses JSON metadata to automate the workflow.
- Improvements to channel social reach using groups to promote internal blog posts and bump SEO reach

Deliverables:

1. Video as: [ intro ][ title ][ ...video... ][ outro ]
2. poster as: JPG (title plate)
